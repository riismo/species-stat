# species-stat

This is a little web app that was created to test a theory that furries are more likely to associate with other furries with the same fursona species.

If that sentence didn't make sense, this project is probably of no interest to you.

This does several things:

* Requests read-only Twitter access
* Requests the user input their species
* Gives the user a survey asking the species (if any) of their Twitter follows
* Displays a graph of how their responses compare to the overall distribution
* Gives a sharable link to the user's results
